                    <img src="oldprison.jpg" width="300">
                    <h4>The Old Prison can count 127 years of history including the Colonial times, Apartheid, the
                        Liberation struggle, the political struggle through to the dawn of a democratic South Africa in
                        1994. Built in 1862, the site has housed people of national and international renown including
                        King Dinuzulu, Harry Gwala, Moses Mabhida, Kasturba Gandhi (Gandhi’s wife), Peter Brown, A. S.
                        Chetty, Omar Essack and Derick Marsh
                        The first cell block has been declared a National Monument and is one of the oldest buildings in
                        Pietermaritzburg. The Old Prison is also part of The Freedom Route. </h4>

                    <h3>NELSON MANDELA CAPTURE SITE</h3>
                    <img src="capturesite.jpg" width="300">
                    <h4>Mr Mandela had been travelling in disguise as the chauffeur of the car he drove, and was on the
                        R103 road between Durban and Johannesburg. Apartheid police had been hunting Nelson Mandela down
                        for 17 months and, as he passed along this stretch of road, they were finally able to capture
                        and arrest him. This marked one of the most significant moments in the history of the Apartheid
                        era, as well as the future of this country.
                        The monument in honour of Nelson Mandela and his efforts is a dramatic representation of the
                        multi-faceted influences and the nature of a single human being that had an enormous effect on
                        the identity of a nation.

                    <h4>Situated in the Babanango district in Umgungundlovu, just over two and a half hours drive from
                        Durban, this gravesite pays homage to former Zulu King Dingaan who retreated in a battle against
                        his brother, Mpande.
                        King Dingane was forced to flee to the Hlatikulu forests in the Lebombo mountains, where he was
                        murdered by a group of Swazi Nyawo warriors. The gravesite is the former capital of King
                        Dingaan’s Zulu Kingdom which lasted from 1828 to 1840.</h4>
